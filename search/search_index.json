Raster data are from NASA data archive services (e.g., landsat , modis ) and ESA data services. Data are also hosted as Google Earth Engine Collections . Raster data downloads can be replicated using our example /python/*.py scripting and /rmd/*.Rmd notebooks in the GitHub. Previously extracted data are stored as .csv and geotiff .tif files on CyVerse Data Store . R Markdown notebooks are provided in this repo which will extract and render these data as figures used in the main text. Code, data, and recipes are hosted on CyVerse DataCommons . Original commercial imagery are available from Planet.com .","title":"Data"},{"location":"docker/","text":"We are hosting RStudio Server containers on CyVerse for reproducing the Rmd figures.
